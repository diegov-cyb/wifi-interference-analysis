# wifi-interference-analysis
A hands-on project focused on diagnosing and resolving wireless connectivity issues using Wi-Fi spectrum analysis. This investigation identified interference sources, hardware limitations, and channel congestion affecting network performance.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I analyzed a client's poor wireless connectivity using a Wi-Fi analyzer and identified several key issues impacting network stability and performance. The assessment revealed electromagnetic interference, high noise levels, channel overlap, and outdated hardware limitations. I provided actionable recommendations to improve signal quality, bandwidth, and connection reliability.

## **Key Issues Identified**
- **Electromagnetic Interface (EMI):**
The router was installed inside an electric panel room with thick concrete walls, causing severe signal obstruction and interference.

- **Channel Congestion & Overlap:**
Despite using non-overlapping channels, spectrum analysis revealed significant overlap from nearby networks, contributing to interface.

- **High Noise Levels:**
The Wi-Fi analyzer reported **17% noise**, resulting in packet loss, random disconnections, and instability.

- **Outdated Hardware Limitations:**
The router only supported the **2.4GHz band**, which has limited channels and performs poorly in high-density environments.

## **Recommendation Summary**
Upgrading to a **dual-band router (2.4GHz + 5GHz)** to achieve:

- More channels to minimize interference
- Higher bandwidth for modern devices
- Improved stability and reliable connectivity
